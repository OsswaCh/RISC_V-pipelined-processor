### Top Module - Central Processing Unit (CPU):

The Top Module represents the core processing unit (CPU) and integrates various components responsible for instruction execution.


#### Functionality:
- Fetches instructions from memory.
- Decodes instructions.
- Executes arithmetic and logic operations using the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).
- Manages control signals based on the instruction type (opcode) through the control unit.
Inputs:
- clk: Clock signal - synchronizes the operation of the CPU.
- rst: Reset signal - initializes the CPU to a known state.
Modules Used:
- N bitReg.v: N-bit register module - stores temporary data during instruction execution.
- regFile.v: Register file module - stores general-purpose registers for data manipulation.
- immGen.v: Immediate generator module - generates immediate values for certain instructions.
- NbitMUX.v: N-bit multiplexer module - allows selection between different data sources.
- NbitALU.v: N-bit ALU module - performs arithmetic and logic operations on data.
- ctrl unit.v: Control unit module - generates control signals based on the instruction type.
- nBitShifter.v: N-bit shifter module - shifts data by a specified number of bits.
- alu ctrl.v: ALU control module - generates specific control signals for the ALU based on the instruction.
- Branch Unit.v: Branch unit module - handles conditional branching instructions.
- Memory.v: Memory module - stores both program instructions and data.
- Hazard_detection_unit.v: Hazard detection module - identifies potential hazards during instruction execution.
- Forwarding_unit.v: Forwarding unit module - optimizes instruction execution by forwarding results from previous stages.
- DecompUnit.v: Decompressing unit module â€“ decompresses instructions if in compressed form.

## Notes
- all of the functionalities of the alu for the uncompressed instructions are working 
- the tested functionalities of the compressed instructions are working
- loading, branching and jumping work fine except for the instruction following the correctly ecexuted one, this problem was not encountered in the pipelined implementation of two memories however we started facing it when we implemented the single memory 
- the forwarding is detected and applied correctly 
- storing sometimes have glitches we couldnt fix 
- the rest of the tested functionalities are working fine
